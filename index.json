[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"The Roth Lab at Ohio State University was established in Fall of 2021. We are a group of scientists aspiring to learn more about fungi and oomycetes, and how they interact with plants. We primarily study fungal and oomycete plant pathogens at a molecular level in order to gain a better understanding of what genes, proteins, and metabolites are involved in causing plant diseases. By gaining a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms deployed by fungi and oomycetes to induce disease susceptibility, we hope to identify potential avenues of intervention to prevent disease from occuring. Research projects also include in-field research to understand the impacts of current disease management practices on crop health and yield. We hope that future field projects will also include functional validation of enhanced resistance of genetically engineered crops developed in the lab.\nLab photo, October 2022.

As a child I wanted to be a librarian, but those plans changed when I stumbled upon a television series of Neil Shubin’s Your Inner Fish. I found myself fascinated with genetics and evolution and decided to become a scientist. My interest in plant pathology grew in the summer of 2021 when I participated in an REU at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. I spent the summer in a plant virology lab led by Dr. Hernan Garcia-Ruiz where I worked on developing a replication system for Maize chlorotic mottle virus in yeast. In spring of 2022 I earned a Bachelor of Arts from Concordia College in Moorhead with majors in biology, computer science, and Spanish. In August of 2022, I moved to Ohio and joined the Roth lab to pursue a PhD in Plant Pathology.

Nonetheless, I learned a lot about farming as a kid, particularly about all of the challenges of farming. In college, I found a way to merge my farming background with my emerging interests in genetics and cell biology through plant research.\nBroadly speaking, my research interests are understanding how organisms interact with other organisms, and what factors affect those interactions. More specifically, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in how plants respond to pathogens, and how pathogens respond to plants. Questions that drive my curiosity are; what causes a successful plant defense response? What causes a successful pathogen infection? How do farming practices and weather events affect plant diseases?\nIn my free time, I love spending time with my wife and two dogs. We frequently go hiking, mushroom hunting, and camping.

My first taste of lab exposure started at Kent State University where I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology with a minor in Chemistry. I started working for Dr. Joseph Ortiz in the geology department. This lab’s focus was on monitoring the harmful algae bloom (HAB) in Lake Erie as well as other smaller satellite lakes around Erie. My involvement in this lab included field work on the lake, taking water samples, reading the light reflectance using a radiometer, and processing satellite imagery for ground-truth data. I then moved onto work for Dr. John Finer at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. This lab’s focus was on utilizing highly expressed genetic promoters in soybean for genetic modification. My contributions to this lab include growth media prep, PCR prep, particle bombardment, gel electrophoresis, work in the greenhouse, and more. Once the project that I was funded under was completed, I started working for Dr Chris Blackwood at Kent State University. This lab’s purpose was to study the interactions between soil-borne microbes and tree roots, specifically their mycorrhizal interactions. Here, I was tasked with a copious number of PCRs and gel electrophoresis, as well as field work and greenhouse work. I greatly enjoyed working in this lab and I believe it prompted my interest in studying plant/microbe interaction. Once I graduated, my first full-time laboratory job was at Summit Environmental Technologies as an analyst for the volatile organics lab. Here I prepped solid and liquid samples, ran the samples through a gas chromatography machine and a mass spectrometer, and analyzed the resulting peaks. I often worked in the metals department prepping their samples as well. Our goal in this lab was to detect pollutants in different media such as wastewater, drinking water, and soil. I am now pursuing a PhD in Plant Pathology at the Ohio State University’s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center where I will be studying microbes suspected in grafting failures in domestically grown chestnut trees. In my free time, you will likely find me outside hiking (as long as the weather is reasonable) and I greatly enjoy using the iNaturalist app on hikes to determine different taxon in real time.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa7e7b9619e30497122eb50fb5d9446a","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/authors/nina_ward/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/nina_ward/","section":"authors","summary":"I have pursued a career in the STEM field ever since I was a child.

Agriculture was not always my first choice. I had intended to study medicine at the University of Guyana, but slots for admission to the biology program were full. So, I signed on for agriculture instead, planning to transfer after one semester. But I developed a curiosity for agriculture, and it worked out for the best! After earning my bachelor’s degree, I worked for the National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute in my home country and was selected for a master’s-level research assistantship at University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff as a top graduate in my program. While working toward my MS in agricultural regulations, I applied to Purdue University where I later obtained my Ph.D. in Botany and Plant Pathology.\nResearch interests: My research interests lie within field crop pathology, understanding plant pathogens, their interactions, biology, genetics and management. My current research focuses on soybean-Sclerotinia effector-R-genes interactions, genomics and management in Midwestern United States. During my doctoral program at Purdue University, I actively carried out research that bridged the gaps in knowledge and expanded our understanding into the population dynamics, biology, and management of the newly emerged corn-Phyllachora maydis pathosystem in the Midwest.\nApart from this, I have a background in molecular biology and plant biotechnology, which I developed during my master studies at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. There I learnt the importance of how to engineer crops so that they can withstand or tolerate plant disease and environmental disorders creating a well-rounded background in this field for myself. I have hopes of becoming a leading scientist/pioneer in field crop pathology with global impacts and collaborations.

Interestingly, the resistant soybean line developed a strong \u0026ldquo;red stem\u0026rdquo; phenotype (pictured above).\nComparing genetic responses between the two soybean lines indicated that a downregulation of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway may be a key to mounting a resistance response. Additional metabolomics efforts showed that phenylpropanoid intermediates accumulated higher in the resistant line than the susceptible line. Finally, these phenylpropanoid intermediate compounds were shown to have anti-fungal activity, specifically targeting ergosterol biosynthesis. My work is continuing on this project by identifying key genetic components of the phenylpropanoid pathway in soybean and using a gene silencing approach to knock down each phenylpropanoid gene candidate.

Combinations of row spacings, seeding rates, and fungicide applications were examined in multi-site field trials across the Upper Midwest from 2017-2019. These trials revealed that wide row spacing and low seeding rates individually reduced SSR levels but also reduced yields. Yields were similar across the three higher seeding rates examined. However, site-years where SSR developed showed the highest partial profits in the intermediate seeding rates. This indicates that partial profits in diseased fields were negatively impacted by high seeding rates, but this trend was not observed when SSR did not develop. Fungicides strongly reduced the development of SSR, while also increasing yields. However, there was a reduction in partial profits due to their use at a low soybean sale price, but at higher sale prices fungicide use was similar to not treating. Additionally, the production of new inoculum was predicted from disease incidence, serving as an indicator of increased risk for SSR development in future years. Overall, this study suggests the use of wide rows and low seeding rates could be useful in fields with a history of SSR, while reserving narrow rows and higher seeding rates for fields without a history of SSR.","tags":null,"title":"Integration of Row Spacing, Seeding Rates, and Fungicide Application for Control of Sclerotinia Stem Rot in *Glycine max*","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shao, D.","Smith, D.L.","Kabbage, M.","Roth, M.G."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622937600,"objectID":"24caa461e804525d2d5965240b7cb637","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/publication/17-necrotrophic-effectors/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/17-necrotrophic-effectors/","section":"publication","summary":"Plant diseases caused by necrotrophic fungal pathogens result in large economic losses in field crop production worldwide.

Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015) who proposed dividing *Fusarium* into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus *Neocosmospora*, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al.

Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of *Fusarium* including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a *Fusarium* that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as *Neocosmospora* were recombined in *Fusarium*, and nine others were renamed *Fusarium*.

Part of this innate immune system is the presence of membrane bound proteins that can recognize specific molecules in the surrounding environment. These genes go by many different names, but are most commonly referred to as R-genes, where \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; stands for either \u0026ldquo;resistance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;receptor\u0026rdquo;. When an R-gene recognizes certain molecules from plant pathogens, the R-gene can initiate defense signals to prevent the pathogen from infecting the plant. These defense signals often culminate in localized plant cell death - sacrificing part of the plant to save the whole organism.\nHowever, some fungal plant pathogens specifically feed on dead plant tissue. Therefore, plant cell death is exactly what the fungal pathogen wants. Therefore, some necrotrophic fungi purposely release molecules that can be recognzied by R-genes, triggering localized plant cell death. This concept is referred to as the inverse gene-for-gene model (pictured above). Key examples of this have been shown in two different fungal diseases of wheat; tan spot (Ciuffetti et al 2010), and Stagonospora nodorum blotch (Friesen and Faris 2010).\nUsing a bioinformatics approach, I analyzed the transcriptomes of susceptible and resistant soybean lines over time after inoculation with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. I am specifically interested in identifying genes that showed opposite trends between the two lines in response to fungal infection. Genes that increased in the resistant line with a corresponding decrease in the susceptible line may indicate that gene\u0026rsquo;s role in resistance. Likewise, genes that increased in the susceptible line with a corresponding decrease in the resistant line may indicate that gene\u0026rsquo;s role in susceptibility. A graphical abstract of this concept can be found below. Identifying genes based on this trend resulted in many gene candidates. To narrow down the search, I included additional criteria involving overall expression levels and statistics. These criteria included 1) overall average expression level \u0026gt; 1 rpkm, 2) expression present in both susceptible and resistant lines, and 3) no significant difference at 0 hpi. These criteria allowed us to identify genes that have strong expression levels (1) that change significantly in opposite directions (2), specifically in response to S. sclerotiorum (3). This narrowed the list of candidates down to 1 gene, an R-gene that increased significantly in the susceptible line, but went down and stayed very low in the resistant line. Using a combination of reverse genetics approaches, virus-induced gene silencing, transient expression, and yeast two hybrid, I hope to validate the role of this R-gene in triggering plant cell death and also identify the cognate S. sclerotiorum protein that activates this susceptibility gene.

Benzamides are hypothesized to bind to b-tubulin, thus disrupting microtubule assembly. Recently, there have been reports of corn- and soybean-associated oomycetes that are insensitive to ethaboxam despite never having been exposed. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history and molecular mechanism of ethaboxam insensitivity. We tested the sensitivity of 194 isolates representing 83 species across four oomycete genera in the Peronosporalean lineage that were never exposed to ethaboxam. In all, 84% of isolates were sensitive to ethaboxam (effective concentration to reduce optical density at 600 nm by 50% when compared with the nonamended control [EC50] 11 μg ml_1). Of the insensitive isolates, two different transversion mutations were present in the 239th codon in b-tubulin within three monophyletic groups of *Pythium* spp. The transversion mutations lead to the same amino acid change from an ancestral cysteine to serine (C239S), which coincides with ethaboxam insensitivity. In a treated soybean seed virulence assay, disease severity was not reduced on ethaboxam-treated seed for an isolate of *Pythium aphanidermatum* containing a S239 but was reduced for an isolate of *P. irregulare* containing a C239. We queried publicly available b-tubulin sequences from other oomycetes in the Peronosporalean lineage to search for C239S mutations from other species not represented in our collection. This search resulted in other taxa that were either homozygous or heterozygous for C239S, including all available species within the genus Peronospora. Evidence presented herein supports the hypothesis that the convergent evolution of C239S within Peronosporalean oomycetes occurred without selection from ethaboxam yet confers insensitivity. We propose several evolutionary hypotheses for the repeated evolution of the C239S mutation.","tags":null,"title":"Convergent evolution of C239S mutation in Pythium spp. β-tubulin coincides with inherent insensitivity to ethaboxam","type":"publication"},{"authors":["McCoy, A.G.","Roth, M.G.","Shay, R.","Noel, Z.A.","Jayawardana, M.A.","Longley, R.W.","Bonito, G.","Chilvers, M.I."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566777600,"objectID":"a18e699fb608398f1bb533d1628a14f2","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/publication/9-tar-spot-phytobiomes/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9-tar-spot-phytobiomes/","section":"publication","summary":"Tar spot is a fungal disease complex of corn that has been destructive and yield limiting in Central and South America for nearly 5 0 years. *Phyllachora maydis*, the causal agent of tar spot, is an emerging corn pathogen in the United States, first reported in 2015 from major corn producing regions of the country. The tar spot disease complex putatively includes *Monographella maydis* (syn. *Microdochium maydis*), which increases disease damage through the development of necrotic halos surrounding tar spot lesions. These necrotic halos, termed “fish-eye” symptoms, have been identified in the United States, though *Monographella maydis* has not yet been confirmed. A recent surge in disease severity and loss of yield attributed to tar spot in the United States has led to increased attention and expanded efforts to understand the disease complex and how to manage it. In this study, next- generation sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) ribosomal DNA was used to identify fungal taxa that distinguish tar spot infections with or without fish-eye symptoms. Fungal communities within tar spot only lesions were significantly different from communities having fish-eye symptoms. Two low abundance operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified as *Microdochium* sp., however, neither were associated with fish-eye symptom development. Interestingly, a single OTU was found to be significantly more abundant in fish-eye lesions compared with tar spot lesions and had a 91% ITS1 identity to *Neottiosporina paspali*. In addition, the occurrence of this OTU was positively associated with Phyllachora maydis fish-eye symptom networks, but not in tar spot symptom networks. *Neottiosporina paspali* has been reported to cause necrotic lesions on various monocot grasses. Whether the related fungus we detected is part of the tar spot complex of corn and responsible for fish-eye lesions remains to be tested. Alternatively, many OTUs identified as *Phyllachora maydis*, suggesting that different isolate genotypes may be capable of causing both tar spot and fish-eye symptoms, independent of other fungi.

One of the most significant causes of soybean yield loss annually in the U.S. is sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by soil-borne fungi in the *Fusarium solani* species complex. Two of these species, *F. virguliforme* and *F. brasiliense*, have been discovered in the U.S. The genetic mechanisms that these pathogens employ to induce root rot and SDS are largely unknown. Previous methods describing *F. virguliforme* protoplast generation and transformation have been used to study gene function, but these methods lack important details and controls. In addition, no reports of protoplast generation and genetic transformation have been made for *F. brasiliense*. We developed a new protocol for developing fungal protoplasts in these Fusarium species and test the protoplasts for the ability to take up foreign DNA. We show that wild-type strains of *F. virguliforme* and *F. brasiliense* are sensitive to the antibiotics hygromycin and nourseothricin, but strains transformed with resistance genes displayed resistance to these antibiotics. In addition, integration of fluorescent protein reporter genes demonstrates that the foreign DNA is expressed and results in a functional protein, providing fluorescence to both pathogens. This protocol provides significant details for reproducibly producing protoplasts and transforming *F. virguliforme* and *F. brasiliense*. The protocol can be used to develop high quality protoplasts for further investigations into genetic mechanisms of growth and pathogenicity of *F. virguliforme* and *F. brasiliense*.

These results suggest that FvNIS1 may target a pathway conserved across soybean and tobacco to induce necrosis, while FvTox1 may target a soybean-specific pathway to induce chlorosis.

SDS disease symptoms include root rot and foliar symptoms induced by fungal toxins. Soybean cultivar resistance is one of the most effective SDS disease management options, but no cultivar displays complete resistance. Soybean SDS foliar symptoms are the primary phenotype used to screen and breed for SDS resistance. Root rot or root colonization measures are seldom utilized, partly due to the lack of convenient and accurate methods for quantification of *F. virguliforme*. In this study, greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine the temporal dynamics of *F. virguliforme* colonization of soybean roots using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The infection coefficient (IC), or ratio of *F. virguliforme* DNA to soybean DNA, was determined in soybean cultivars with different SDS foliar resistance ratings. In greenhouse experiments, *F. virguliforme* was detected in all cultivars 7 days after planting (DAP), with a peak in IC at 14 DAP. All soybean cultivars developed SDS foliar symptoms, but *F. virguliforme* soybean root colonization levels did not significantly correlate with SDS foliar symptom severity. In field experiments, SDS foliar symptoms developed among soybean cultivars in alignment with provided foliar resistance ratings; however, the *F. virguliforme* IC were not significantly different between SDS foliar symptomatic and asymptomatic cultivars. *F. virguliforme* was detected in all cultivars at the first sample collection point 25 DAP (V3 vegetative growth stage), and the IC increased throughout the season, peaking at the last sample collection point 153 DAP (postharvest). Collectively, appearance and disease severity ratings of SDS foliar symptoms were not associated with *F. virguliforme* quantity in roots, suggesting a need to include *F. virguliforme* root colonization in breeding efforts to screen soybean germplasm for *F. virguliforme* root infection resistance.

To determine if fluopyram could be used for management of SDS caused by these species, *in vitro* sensitivity tests of the three Fusarium species to fluopyram were conducted. The mean EC50 values of *F. brasiliense* and *F. virguliforme* strains to fluopyram were 1.96 and 2.21 μg ml^−1^, respectively, but interestingly *F. tucumaniae* strains were highly sensitive (mean EC50 = 0.25 μg ml^−1^) to fluopyram compared to strains of the other two species. A sequence analysis of Sdh genes of Fusarium strains revealed that the *F. tucumaniae* strains contain an arginine at codon 277 in the SdhB gene instead of a glycine as in other Fusarium species. Replacement of glycine to arginine in SdhB-277 in a *F. virguliforme* wild-type strain Mont-1 through genetic transformation resulted in increased sensitivity to two SDHI fungicides, fluopyram and boscalid. Similar to a *F. tucumaniae* strain, the Mont-1 (SdhBG277R) mutant caused less SDS and root rot disease than Mont-1 on soybean seedlings with the fluopyram seed treatment. Our study suggests the amino acid difference in the SdhB in *F. tucumaniae* results in fluopyram being efficacious if used as a seed treatment for management of *F. tucumaniae*, which is the most abundant SDS causing species in South America.

This is my first post, and it really stems from a discussion I had with a fellow student recently about herbicides in agriculture (more on that topic in a later post). As scientists, both of us have studied the intricacies of genetics and understand how genetic modifications work, and how they can change an organism\u0026rsquo;s features. It\u0026rsquo;s really fascinating how genetics works, and the powerful potential it has to solve problems, both inside and outside of agriculture.\nAll living things (plants, animals, fungi, etc.) have DNA. A common DNA analogy is with blueprints. DNA is similar to the blueprint of a house. DNA is not a house, but it has all of the information needed to build one. Many blueprints have common features, like a roof, a basement, and a front door. Similarly, some DNA is common among all living things. Some blueprints have more specific features found in more specific groups of houses like an attached garage, walk in closets, or hot tub. Similarly, some DNA is common among groups of organisms, like plants or animals, but not both. Finally, some blueprints have specific instructions for something so unique, it is only found in three or four houses in the world. DNA that is common only to a few unique species is also this way.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s with all the fuss about genetic modifications? People change blueprints to houses all the time. Well, I think it boils down to this: blueprints, when executed, form a stationary, permanent, non-being object. DNA, when executed, forms a living thing that can grow, develop, react, and respond. Since an executed DNA life-form takes on all of these active characteristics, it is considered \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo;, and ought not be changed or tainted. But the fact of the matter is, blueprints can be changed, and the result of the change can significantly impact the outcome. Adding a crocodile-filled moat around a house might increase the property value to some who value security, but it may decrease property value to others who value the safety of their children playing in the yard. Changes to DNA need to be viewed the same way - how will the outcome be beneficial, and how might it be harmful?\nSo how is all of this done? DNA is something we inherit, we\u0026rsquo;re born with it, so how can it be changed? Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to a different analogy; computers. If you\u0026rsquo;ve found your way onto this website, I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you know a thing or two about how computers work. There are some foundational parts of a computer that you probably don\u0026rsquo;t know much about - the processor, motherboard, hard drive, kernel, etc. These foundational parts are a lot like DNA. You may have heard of it, but you\u0026rsquo;re not exactly sure what they do or why they\u0026rsquo;re important. What you do know is that double-clicking an icon on your desktop will open the application, which is something you can actually work with. This process of launching an application from your hard drive is a lot like a cell expressing a copy of RNA (an application) from a DNA template (hard drive). When the application finally launches, you can begin using it, to execute tasks. In a similar way, RNA (an application) is translated into a protein (that can execute tasks).\n[That last part of the analogy is a bit of stretch, I know. If you have suggestions for explaining it better, let me know in the comments below!]\nScientists discovered how to transfer DNA from one organism to another by studying a bacterial plant pathogen (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) that evolved the ability to add it\u0026rsquo;s own DNA into a plant cell. Think of this as a bacteria containing a flash drive. It can make a copy of part of its DNA (hard drive) and transfer it (unplug the flash drive) into another organism (plugging it into another computer). Here, the DNA can work the same way it did in the bacteria, just like Microsoft Word works the same way on many computers. The total DNA is different between the two organisms (the computers have different hard drives), but some of the DNA is the same such that both can express the DNA as RNA (run the application) and make a functioning protein (perform a task).\nThe toughest part about Genetics is all of the jargon. In this blog, I\u0026rsquo;d like to present things in as simple terms as possible - not to be condescending, but to be understandable and approachable. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that I never used the word \u0026ldquo;gene\u0026rdquo;, even though the whole blog is about genetics and DNA. It makes things more difficult to write, but I hope simplifying the terms makes it easier to read. For those that are interested in an exact definition, a gene is a piece DNA that gets copied into RNA and translated into a functioning protein. All genes are DNA, but not all DNA are genes!\nThere are a lot of details the I left out, which are essential for physically performing genetic modifications. There are a lot of great (peer reviewed) resources out there if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the details, the most comprehensive one that I like is here.\n","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"5842f7a73fb11e0027e9096e9741e351","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/post/1_gmo-metaphors/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/1_gmo-metaphors/","section":"post","summary":"Hey everyone, thanks for stumbling on this blog.

There are more than 80 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with soybean resistance to SDS. The validity of these QTL and SNPs is questionable because of the complexity in phenotyping methodologies, the disease synergism between SDS and soybean cyst nematode (SCN), the variability from the interactions between soybean genotypes and environments, and the inconsistencies in the QTL nomenclature. This review organizes SDS mapping results and proposes the Rfv (resistance to *Fusarium virguliforme*) nomenclature based on supporting criteria described in the text. Among ten reproducible loci receiving our Rfv nomenclature, Rfv18-01 is mostly supported by field studies and it co-localizes to the SCN resistance locus rhg1. The possibility that Rfv18-01 is a pleiotropic resistance locus and the concern about Rfv18-01 being confounded with Rhg1 is discussed. On the other hand, Rfv06-01, Rfv06-02, Rfv09-01, Rfv13-01, and Rfv16-01 were identified both by screening soybean leaves against phytotoxic culture filtrates and by evaluating SDS severity in fields. Future phenotyping using leaf- and root-specific resistance screening methodologies may improve the precision of SDS resistance, and advanced genetic studies may further clarify the interactions among soybean genotypes, *F. virguliforme*, SCN, and environments. The review provides a summary of the SDS resistance literature and proposes a framework for communicating SDS resistance loci for future research considering molecular interactions and genetic breeding for soybean SDS resistance.","tags":null,"title":"Integration of Sudden Death Syndrome Resistance Loci in the Soybean Genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kuhlgert, S.","Austic, G.","Zegarac, R.","Osei-Bonsu, I.","Hoh, D.","Chilvers, M.I.","Roth, M.G.","Bi, K.","TerAvest, D.","Weebadde, P.","Kramer, D.M."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475280000,"objectID":"95869869b911f78f4dfbef357a9f917e","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/publication/1-multispeq/","publishdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1-multispeq/","section":"publication","summary":"Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools 2 for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.","tags":null,"title":"MultispeQ Beta: a tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to the open PhotosynQ network","type":"publication"}]
