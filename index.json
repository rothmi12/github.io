Consistent threats exist across both northern and southern production regions and include the soybean cyst nematode, charcoal rot, and seedling diseases. In contrast, significant soybean diseases like Phytophthora stem and root rot, sudden death syndrome, and Sclerotinia stem rot (white mold) are intermittent threats that can be heavily influenced by environmental factors. Additional threats to soybean production that have emerged in recent years as more common problems in soybean production include root-knot and reniform nematodes, frogeye leaf spot, and Diaporthe diseases. Disease in any crop will only occur when the three components of the disease triangle are present; a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a conducive environment. If an environment is becoming more conducive for a particular disease, it is important that farmers and practitioners are prepared to manage the problem.The information in this review was compiled to help assist agriculturalists in being proactive in managing new soybean diseases that may be emerging in new areas.To do this, we provide; 1) an overview of the impact and disease cycle for major soybean diseases currently causing significant yield losses in the United States, 2) a comprehensive review of the current management strategies for each soybean disease, and 3) insights into the epidemiology of each pathogen, including the likelihood of outbreaks and expansion to additional geographic regions based on current trends in climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated Management of Important Soybean Pathogens of the United States in Changing Climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mitchell G.

Fluopyram is a fungicide commonly used in soybean seed treatments intended to control soilborne fungal pathogens; however, recent studies have also suggested inhibitory effects on SCN. We examined the effects of a fluopyram seed treatment, ILeVO, on SCN reproduction, sudden death syndrome (SDS) development, and yield in a 3-year field study. Overall, fluopyram had a significant effect on yield (P = 0.046) and end-of-season SCN eggs and second-stage juveniles (Pf, P = 0.033) but no significant effect on SCN reproduction (Rf) or SDS disease index (P  0.05). Post hoc tests indicated that fluopyram increased yield and suppressed SCN quantities. However, Rf was consistently greater than 1 whether or not the seed was treated with fluopyram, indicating that SCN populations were still increasing in the presence of fluopyram. A follow-up greenhouse study indicated that fluopyram reduced SCN relative to nontreated controls, as observed in the field, but only reduced SCN DNA within roots of a susceptible cultivar. These results indicate that fluopyram can suppress SCN quantities relative to nontreated seed but may not successfully reduce nematode populations without the use of additional management strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Fluopyram Suppresses Population Densities of Heterodera glycines in Field and Greenhouse Studies in Michigan","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Microbes and plants interact by releasing recognizing different molecules. In plant pathology, pathogen-secreted molecules are often referred to as \u0026ldquo;effectors\u0026rdquo; because they effect plant physiology to establish an infection. However, pathogens also secrete factors that are not always classified as effectors, such as cell-wall degrading enzymes and secondary metabolites (reviewed in Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009). Despite their categorization, the mechanisms by which pathogen-secreted molecules effect plants are very interesting to many researchers like me.\nUsing a time-course transcriptome dataset, I have helped our research group identify candidate effector genes in S. sclerotiorum. Additionally, a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated transformation method developed by colleagues have facilitated the rapid, efficient transformation of S. sclerotiorum, allowing for characterization of genes involved in fungal development and pathogenicity on soybean and other plants. One effector that I am currently characterizes is particularly interesting because it appears to have two functions, able to act as a cell wall degrading enzyme and as an inducer of plant cell death.\n","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"d4481cf8f1bf1c7d9061abdaf229c695","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/project/3_sclerotinia_effectors/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/3_sclerotinia_effectors/","section":"project","summary":"Proteins secreted by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ during infection of soybean play many different roles in helping establish disease.

These species are morphologically difficult to distinguish and often require molecular tools for proper diagnosis to a species level. Here, a Taq-Man probe-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to distinguish Fusarium brasiliense from other closely related species within clade 2 of the FSSC. The assay displays high specificity against close relatives and high sensitivity, with a detection limit of 100 fg. This assay was able to detect F. brasiliense from purified mycelia, infected dry bean roots, and soil samples throughout Michigan. When multiplexed with an existing qPCR assay specific to Fusarium virguliforme, accurate quantification of both F. brasiliense and F. virguliforme was obtained, which can facilitate accurate diagnoses and identify coinfections with a single reaction. The assay is compatible with multiple qPCR thermal cycling platforms and will be helpful in providing accurate detection of F. brasiliense. Management of root rot and SDS pathogens in clade 2 of the FSSC is challenging and must be done proactively, because no midseason management strategies currently exist. However, accurate detection can facilitate management decisions for subsequent growing seasons to successfully manage these pathogens.","tags":null,"title":"Diagnostic qPCR Assay to Detect Fusarium brasiliense, a causal agent of soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Root Rot of Dry Bean","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The plant immune system is considered to be innate rather than adaptive. Part of this innate immune system is the presence of membrane bound proteins that can recognize specific molecules in the surrounding environment. These genes go by many different names, but are most commonly referred to as R-genes, where \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; stands for either \u0026ldquo;resistance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;receptor\u0026rdquo;. When an R-gene recognizes certain molecules from plant pathogens, the R-gene can initiate defense signals to prevent the pathogen from infecting the plant. These defense signals often culminate in localized plant cell death - sacrificing part of the plant to save the whole organism.\nHowever, some fungal plant pathogens specifically feed on dead plant tissue. Therefore, plant cell death is exactly what the fungal pathogen wants. Therefore, some necrotrophic fungi purposely release molecules that can be recognzied by R-genes, triggering localized plant cell death. This concept is referred to as the inverse gene-for-gene model (pictured above). Key examples of this have been shown in two different fungal diseases of wheat; tan spot (Ciuffetti et al 2010), and Stagonospora nodorum blotch (Friesen and Faris 2010).\nUsing a bioinformatics approach, I analyzed the transcriptomes of susceptible and resistant soybean lines over time after inoculation with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. I am specifically interested in identifying genes that showed opposite trends between the two lines in response to fungal infection. Genes that increased in the resistant line with a corresponding decrease in the susceptible line may indicate that gene\u0026rsquo;s role in resistance. Likewise, genes that increased in the susceptible line with a corresponding decrease in the resistant line may indicate that gene\u0026rsquo;s role in susceptibility. A graphical abstract of this concept can be found below. Identifying genes based on this trend resulted in many gene candidates. To narrow down the search, I included additional criteria involving overall expression levels and statistics. These criteria included 1) overall average expression level \u0026gt; 1 rpkm, 2) expression present in both susceptible and resistant lines, and 3) no significant difference at 0 hpi. These criteria allowed us to identify genes that have strong expression levels (1) that change significantly in opposite directions (2), specifically in response to S. sclerotiorum (3). This narrowed the list of candidates down to 1 gene, an R-gene that increased significantly in the susceptible line, but went down and stayed very low in the resistant line. Using a combination of reverse genetics approaches, virus-induced gene silencing, transient expression, and yeast two hybrid, I hope to validate the role of this R-gene in triggering plant cell death and also identify the cognate S. sclerotiorum protein that activates this susceptibility gene.

Benzamides are hypothesized to bind to b-tubulin, thus disrupting microtubule assembly. Recently, there have been reports of corn- and soybean-associated oomycetes that are insensitive to ethaboxam despite never having been exposed. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history and molecular mechanism of ethaboxam insensitivity. We tested the sensitivity of 194 isolates representing 83 species across four oomycete genera in the Peronosporalean lineage that were never exposed to ethaboxam. In all, 84% of isolates were sensitive to ethaboxam (effective concentration to reduce optical density at 600 nm by 50% when compared with the nonamended control [EC50] 11 μg ml_1). Of the insensitive isolates, two different transversion mutations were present in the 239th codon in b-tubulin within three monophyletic groups of Pythium spp. The transversion mutations lead to the same amino acid change from an ancestral cysteine to serine (C239S), which coincides with ethaboxam insensitivity. In a treated soybean seed virulence assay, disease severity was not reduced on ethaboxam-treated seed for an isolate of Pythium aphanidermatum containing a S239 but was reduced for an isolate of P. irregulare containing a C239. We queried publicly available b-tubulin sequences from other oomycetes in the Peronosporalean lineage to search for C239S mutations from other species not represented in our collection. This search resulted in other taxa that were either homozygous or heterozygous for C239S, including all available species within the genus Peronospora. Evidence presented herein supports the hypothesis that the convergent evolution of C239S within Peronosporalean oomycetes occurred without selection from ethaboxam yet confers insensitivity. We propose several evolutionary hypotheses for the repeated evolution of the C239S mutation.","tags":null,"title":"Convergent evolution of C239S mutation in Pythium spp. β-tubulin coincides with inherent insensitivity to ethaboxam","type":"publication"},{"authors":["McCoy, A.G.","Roth, M.G.","Shay, R.","Noel, Z.A.","Jayawardana, M.A.","Longley, R.W.","Bonito, G.","Chilvers, M.I."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566777600,"objectID":"a18e699fb608398f1bb533d1628a14f2","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/publication/9-tar-spot-phytobiomes/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9-tar-spot-phytobiomes/","section":"publication","summary":"Tar spot is a fungal disease complex of corn that has been destructive and yield limiting in Central and South America for nearly 5 0 years. Phyllachora maydis, the causal agent of tar spot, is an emerging corn pathogen in the United States, first reported in 2015 from major corn producing regions of the country. The tar spot disease complex putatively includes Monographella maydis (syn. Microdochium maydis), which increases disease damage through the development of necrotic halos surrounding tar spot lesions. These necrotic halos, termed “fish-eye” symptoms, have been identified in the United States, though Monographella maydis has not yet been confirmed. A recent surge in disease severity and loss of yield attributed to tar spot in the United States has led to increased attention and expanded efforts to understand the disease complex and how to manage it. In this study, next- generation sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) ribosomal DNA was used to identify fungal taxa that distinguish tar spot infections with or without fish-eye symptoms. Fungal communities within tar spot only lesions were significantly different from communities having fish-eye symptoms. Two low abundance operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified as Microdochium sp., however, neither were associated with fish-eye symptom development. Interestingly, a single OTU was found to be significantly more abundant in fish-eye lesions compared with tar spot lesions and had a 91% ITS1 identity to Neottiosporina paspali. In addition, the occurrence of this OTU was positively associated with Phyllachora maydis fish-eye symptom networks, but not in tar spot symptom networks. Neottiosporina paspali has been reported to cause necrotic lesions on various monocot grasses. Whether the related fungus we detected is part of the tar spot complex of corn and responsible for fish-eye lesions remains to be tested. Alternatively, many OTUs identified as Phyllachora maydis, suggesting that different isolate genotypes may be capable of causing both tar spot and fish-eye symptoms, independent of other fungi. We conclude that Monographella maydis is not required for fish-eye symptoms in tar spot of corn.","tags":null,"title":"Next Generation Sequencing Identification of Fungal Communities Within the Tar Spot Complex of Corn in Michigan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mitchell G.

One of the most significant causes of soybean yield loss annually in the U.S. is sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by soil-borne fungi in the Fusarium solani species complex. Two of these species, F. virguliforme and F. brasiliense, have been discovered in the U.S. The genetic mechanisms that these pathogens employ to induce root rot and SDS are largely unknown. Previous methods describing F. virguliforme protoplast generation and transformation have been used to study gene function, but these methods lack important details and controls. In addition, no reports of protoplast generation and genetic transformation have been made for F. brasiliense. We developed a new protocol for developing fungal protoplasts in these Fusarium species and test the protoplasts for the ability to take up foreign DNA. We show that wild-type strains of F. virguliforme and F. brasiliense are sensitive to the antibiotics hygromycin and nourseothricin, but strains transformed with resistance genes displayed resistance to these antibiotics. In addition, integration of fluorescent protein reporter genes demonstrates that the foreign DNA is expressed and results in a functional protein, providing fluorescence to both pathogens. This protocol provides significant details for reproducibly producing protoplasts and transforming F. virguliforme and F. brasiliense. The protocol can be used to develop high quality protoplasts for further investigations into genetic mechanisms of growth and pathogenicity of F. virguliforme and F. brasiliense. Fluorescent strains developed in this study can be used to investigate temporal colonization and potential host preferences of these species.","tags":null,"title":"A Protoplast Generation and Transformation Methods for Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome Causal Agents Fusarium virguliforme and F. brasiliense","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

These results suggest that FvNIS1 may target a pathway conserved across soybean and tobacco to induce necrosis, while FvTox1 may target a soybean-specific pathway to induce chlorosis.

Soybean SDS foliar symptoms are the primary phenotype used to screen and breed for SDS resistance. Root rot or root colonization measures are seldom utilized, partly due to the lack of convenient and accurate methods for quantification of F. virguliforme. In this study, greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine the temporal dynamics of F. virguliforme colonization of soybean roots using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The infection coefficient (IC), or ratio of F. virguliforme DNA to soybean DNA, was determined in soybean cultivars with different SDS foliar resistance ratings. In greenhouse experiments, F. virguliforme was detected in all cultivars 7 days after planting (DAP), with a peak in IC at 14 DAP. All soybean cultivars developed SDS foliar symptoms, but F. virguliforme soybean root colonization levels did not significantly correlate with SDS foliar symptom severity. In field experiments, SDS foliar symptoms developed among soybean cultivars in alignment with provided foliar resistance ratings; however, the F. virguliforme IC were not significantly different between SDS foliar symptomatic and asymptomatic cultivars. F. virguliforme was detected in all cultivars at the first sample collection point 25 DAP (V3 vegetative growth stage), and the IC increased throughout the season, peaking at the last sample collection point 153 DAP (postharvest). Collectively, appearance and disease severity ratings of SDS foliar symptoms were not associated with F. virguliforme quantity in roots, suggesting a need to include F. virguliforme root colonization in breeding efforts to screen soybean germplasm for F. virguliforme root infection resistance.

More recently, other species within clade 2 of the Fusarium solani species, F. tucumaniae in South America and F. brasiliense in America and Africa, have been recognized as additional agents capable of causing SDS. To determine if fluopyram could be used for management of SDS caused by these species, in vitro sensitivity tests of the three Fusarium species to fluopyram were conducted. The mean EC50 values of F. brasiliense and F. virguliforme strains to fluopyram were 1.96 and 2.21 μg ml^−1^, respectively, but interestingly F. tucumaniae strains were highly sensitive (mean EC50 = 0.25 μg ml^−1^) to fluopyram compared to strains of the other two species. A sequence analysis of Sdh genes of Fusarium strains revealed that the F. tucumaniae strains contain an arginine at codon 277 in the SdhB gene instead of a glycine as in other Fusarium species. Replacement of glycine to arginine in SdhB-277 in a F. virguliforme wild-type strain Mont-1 through genetic transformation resulted in increased sensitivity to two SDHI fungicides, fluopyram and boscalid. Similar to a F. tucumaniae strain, the Mont-1 (SdhBG277R) mutant caused less SDS and root rot disease than Mont-1 on soybean seedlings with the fluopyram seed treatment. Our study suggests the amino acid difference in the SdhB in F. tucumaniae results in fluopyram being efficacious if used as a seed treatment for management of F. tucumaniae, which is the most abundant SDS causing species in South America. The establishment of baseline sensitivity of Fusarium species to fluopyram will contribute to effective strategies for managing Fusarium diseases in soybean and other pathosystems such as dry bean.","tags":null,"title":"Fluopyram sensitivity and functional characterization of SdhB in the Fusarium solani species complex causing soybean sudden death syndrome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hey everyone, thanks for stumbling on this blog. This is my first post, and it really stems from a discussion I had with a fellow student recently about herbicides in agriculture (more on that topic in a later post). As scientists, both of us have studied the intricacies of genetics and understand how genetic modifications work, and how they can change an organism\u0026rsquo;s features. It\u0026rsquo;s really fascinating how genetics works, and the powerful potential it has to solve problems, both inside and outside of agriculture.\nAll living things (plants, animals, fungi, etc.) have DNA. A common DNA analogy is with blueprints. DNA is similar to the blueprint of a house. DNA is not a house, but it has all of the information needed to build one. Many blueprints have common features, like a roof, a basement, and a front door. Similarly, some DNA is common among all living things. Some blueprints have more specific features found in more specific groups of houses like an attached garage, walk in closets, or hot tub. Similarly, some DNA is common among groups of organisms, like plants or animals, but not both. Finally, some blueprints have specific instructions for something so unique, it is only found in three or four houses in the world. DNA that is common only to a few unique species is also this way.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s with all the fuss about genetic modifications? People change blueprints to houses all the time. Well, I think it boils down to this: blueprints, when executed, form a stationary, permanent, non-being object. DNA, when executed, forms a living thing that can grow, develop, react, and respond. Since an executed DNA life-form takes on all of these active characteristics, it is considered \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo;, and ought not be changed or tainted. But the fact of the matter is, blueprints can be changed, and the result of the change can significantly impact the outcome. Adding a crocodile-filled moat around a house might increase the property value to some who value security, but it may decrease property value to others who value the safety of their children playing in the yard. Changes to DNA need to be viewed the same way - how will the outcome be beneficial, and how might it be harmful?\nSo how is all of this done? DNA is something we inherit, we\u0026rsquo;re born with it, so how can it be changed? Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to a different analogy; computers. If you\u0026rsquo;ve found your way onto this website, I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you know a thing or two about how computers work. There are some foundational parts of a computer that you probably don\u0026rsquo;t know much about - the processor, motherboard, hard drive, kernel, etc. These foundational parts are a lot like DNA. You may have heard of it, but you\u0026rsquo;re not exactly sure what they do or why they\u0026rsquo;re important. What you do know is that double-clicking an icon on your desktop will open the application, which is something you can actually work with. This process of launching an application from your hard drive is a lot like a cell expressing a copy of RNA (an application) from a DNA template (hard drive). When the application finally launches, you can begin using it, to execute tasks. In a similar way, RNA (an application) is translated into a protein (that can execute tasks).\n[That last part of the analogy is a bit of stretch, I know. If you have suggestions for explaining it better, let me know in the comments below!]\nScientists discovered how to transfer DNA from one organism to another by studying a bacterial plant pathogen (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) that evolved the ability to add it\u0026rsquo;s own DNA into a plant cell. Think of this as a bacteria containing a flash drive. It can make a copy of part of its DNA (hard drive) and transfer it (unplug the flash drive) into another organism (plugging it into another computer). Here, the DNA can work the same way it did in the bacteria, just like Microsoft Word works the same way on many computers. The total DNA is different between the two organisms (the computers have different hard drives), but some of the DNA is the same such that both can express the DNA as RNA (run the application) and make a functioning protein (perform a task).\nThe toughest part about Genetics is all of the jargon. In this blog, I\u0026rsquo;d like to present things in as simple terms as possible - not to be condescending, but to be understandable and approachable. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that I never used the word \u0026ldquo;gene\u0026rdquo;, even though the whole blog is about genetics and DNA. It makes things more difficult to write, but I hope simplifying the terms makes it easier to read. For those that are interested in an exact definition, a gene is a piece DNA that gets copied into RNA and translated into a functioning protein. All genes are DNA, but not all DNA are genes!\nThere are a lot of details the I left out, which are essential for physically performing genetic modifications. There are a lot of great (peer reviewed) resources out there if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the details, the most comprehensive one that I like is here.\n","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"5842f7a73fb11e0027e9096e9741e351","permalink":"rothmi12.github.io/post/1_gmo-metaphors/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/1_gmo-metaphors/","section":"post","summary":"Hey everyone, thanks for stumbling on this blog.

There are more than 80 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with soybean resistance to SDS. The validity of these QTL and SNPs is questionable because of the complexity in phenotyping methodologies, the disease synergism between SDS and soybean cyst nematode (SCN), the variability from the interactions between soybean genotypes and environments, and the inconsistencies in the QTL nomenclature. This review organizes SDS mapping results and proposes the Rfv (resistance to Fusarium virguliforme) nomenclature based on supporting criteria described in the text. Among ten reproducible loci receiving our Rfv nomenclature, Rfv18-01 is mostly supported by field studies and it co-localizes to the SCN resistance locus rhg1. The possibility that Rfv18-01 is a pleiotropic resistance locus and the concern about Rfv18-01 being confounded with Rhg1 is discussed. On the other hand, Rfv06-01, Rfv06-02, Rfv09-01, Rfv13-01, and Rfv16-01 were identified both by screening soybean leaves against phytotoxic culture filtrates and by evaluating SDS severity in fields. Future phenotyping using leaf- and root-specific resistance screening methodologies may improve the precision of SDS resistance, and advanced genetic studies may further clarify the interactions among soybean genotypes, F. virguliforme, SCN, and environments. The review provides a summary of the SDS resistance literature and proposes a framework for communicating SDS resistance loci for future research considering molecular interactions and genetic breeding for soybean SDS resistance.","tags":null,"title":"Integration of Sudden Death Syndrome Resistance Loci in the Soybean Genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kuhlgert, S.","Austic, G.","Zegarac, R.","Osei-Bonsu, I.","Hoh, D.","Chilvers, M.I.","Mitchell G.

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools 2 for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.","tags":null,"title":"MultispeQ Beta: a tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to the open PhotosynQ network","type":"publication"}]
